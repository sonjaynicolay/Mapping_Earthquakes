# Mapping Earthquakes
## A visual of Recent Major Earthquakes 

### Overview:


An earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay have already been created. The new task was to show the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates' location on the earth. 
We also are to show all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and the data on a third map.



### Summary:
We are able to see Earthquakes of various magnitudes and their locations along the fault lines and plates around the world. We also are able to click on different levels
of the map/s to see more specific data and information. Specifically where the more recent Major Earthquakes have happened and their magnitudes.
